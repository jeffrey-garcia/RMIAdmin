				RMIAdmin allows you to execute Operating System's command of remote computer 
				locally and wait for the result, must similar to invoking command locally.
				
				<br><br>
				
				For example, you want to run a command "tree c:" in Windows, this command indeed 
				may take a certain time to finish and the output will contain millions lines of 
				information. RMIAdmin will helps you to operate the command, track the status of 
				the execution, and return you the partial result instantly via buffering technique 
				rather than keep you waiting until the command finished on remote computer.
				
				<br><br>
				
				<u>Execute Remote Command</u>
				<ol color="#666666">
					<li>
						Select &quot;Tools&quot; -> &quot;Command Line&quot;, this will brings you to the Command Line Workspace.<br>
						<img src="images/command_line_workspace.gif" alt="0" border="0" width="925" height="584">
					</li>
					<li>
						Choose your target server to operate by clicking the &quot;Select Server&quot; button.
					</li>
					<li>
						All the managed server will be loaded into a list box, simply choose your preferred 
						server, and click &quot;OK&quot; to continue.<br>
						<img src="images/select_server.gif" alt="0" border="0" width="272" height="123">
					</li>
					<li>
						Next click the &quot;Run Command&quot; button, this will open up a 
                       &quot;Command Console&quot; where you could input the command to be executed.<br>
						<img src="images/command_console.gif" alt="0" border="0" width="492" height="427">
					</li>
					<li>
						Key-in any preferred command and click the &quot;Run&quot; to invoke the execution, result 
						of the command will be displayed on the Output Screen of the Command Line Workspace 
						shortly.
					</li>
					<li>
						You may also terminate and executing command by clicking the 
						&quot;Stop&quot; button, this will stop the process at remote server immediately.
					</li>
				</ol>
				
				<br><br>
				
				<u>Usage Tips</u>
				
				<br><br>
				
				Note that the Command Console of RMIAdmin is different to telnet/SSH which support 
				a continous login session in the shell environment. 
				Instead, if you need to execute continous command which is co-related, you have to do 
				this by linking all the commands with the "&&" syntax.
				
				<br><br>
				
				For example in Windows, when you need to perform the following:
				<ul color="#666666">
					<li>Set the %CLASSPATH% variable to include a specific path</li>
					<li>Execute a command or program which is valid only when the above CLASSPATH value has been set</li>
				</ul>
				
				<br><br>
				
				If you try to do this separately with two commands via the Command Console, you will fail 
				obviously. Since the Command Console of RMIAdmin does not retain the same shell environment 
				as the previous command, in other words, the command is for "one-time" only.
				
				<br><br>
				
				Therefore to achieve the above task, here is the workaround:
				<ul color="#666666">
					<li>
						Combine the two commands with the "&&" symbols.
						<br>
						<font face="Arial" size=3 color="#333333">
							set CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%;<i>preferred_path</i> <b>&&</b> <i>some_commands_or_program</i>
						</font>
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				<br><br>
				
				Another examples if we now have to go into a specific directory and then list our all 
				the .exe files, again if we seperate the "cd to_some_folders" command and the "dir *exe" 
				command, we will fail to retrieve the correct output.
				
				<br><br>
				
				Even the RMIAdmin did successfully complete the "cd to_some_folders" command, however 
				when execute the second command, the RMIAdmin will not retain the position from previous 
				command as the execution path.
				
				<br><br>
				
				Hence, to retrieve the correct output:
				<ul color="#666666">
					<li>
						We must link these two commands again by "&&".
						<br>
						<font face="Arial" size=3 color="#333333">
							cd <i>preferred_path</i> <b>&&</b> <i>dir *.exe</i>
						</font>
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				<br><br>
