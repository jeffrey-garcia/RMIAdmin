					</li>
					<li>
						After your RMIAdmin client has been upgraded, we strongly recommended 
						you also upgrade the RMIAdmin software on all of your managed server in order 
						to take effect of all the new features and bug fixes.
						<br><br>
						If you would like to perform the upgrade to all server(s) immediately 
						after your client has been upgraded, simply tick the checkbox to 
						indicate that you would like to have all the managed server(s) upgraded.
						<br>
						<img src="images/upgrade_all_server.gif" align="absmiddle" border="0">
						<br>
						<font color="#FF0066">
							<i>
								* note that the upgrade of server will be performed one by one 
								and not simultaneously.
							</i>
						</font>
						
						<br><br>
						
						To terminate the upgrade immediately, simply click the "Cancel" button.
						
						<br><br>
						
						<font color="#FF0066">
							<i>
								Please note that if you click the "Cancel" button during the download stage, 
								the entire upgrade activity will be abandoned and in this case, your 
								RMIAdmin client and all the managed server(s) will <b>NOT</b> be upgraded.
							</i>
							<br>
							<img src="images/cancel_all_upgrade.gif" align="absmiddle" border="0">
							
							<br><br>
							
							<i>
								Yet if the "Cancel" button is clicked during the upgrade to server, then 
								the upgrade will be abandoned from the next remaining server(s). In this 
								case, your RMIAdmin client has <b>BEEN</b> upgraded together with those 
								managed server(s) at the point when you cancel the upgrade.
