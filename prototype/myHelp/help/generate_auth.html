							RMIAdmin is compriesed of two separate programs: a server and a client.
							<br><br>
							The server application creates some remote objects, makes references to them accessible, 
							and waits for clients to invoke methods on these remote objects, which are registered with 
							the RMI's simple naming facility - the RMIREGISTRY.
							<br><br>
							While the client application gets a remote reference (by looking up the remote registry) 
							to one or more remote objects in the server and then invokes method on them.
							<br><br>
							RMIAdmin allows registered user to achieve secure connection only from validated client by means 
							of encrypting the remote RMI's service name based on a pre-defined key, the RMI Server could then 
							be started using the -k parameter, which indicates that an encrypted service name will be binded to 
							the RMIREGISTRY, only client with the valid key which can decrypt the remote RMI service name can 
							connect with this RMI Server.
							<br><br>
							See the below diagram for details:<br>
							<img src="images/generate_auth_overview.gif" alt="0" border="1" width="713" height="407">
							<br>
							The above illustration depicts the distributed architecture of RMIAdmin that uses the 
							registry to obtain a reference to a remote object. The RMI Server calls the registry 
							to associate (or bind) a name with a remote object. The RMI Client then looks up the 
							remote object by its name in the RMI Server's registry and then invokes a method on 
							it.
							<br><br>
							<u>Usage Instructions:</u>
							<ol color="#666666">
								<li>
									From the toolbar, select "Configure" -> "Generate Authentication"
								</li>
								<li>
									You will then see the below screen, which require to input 2 values.<br>
									<img src="images/generate_auth.gif" alt="0" border="0" width="352" height="192">
								</li>
								<li>
									Input the server key, which is the key used to encrypt the passphrase.
								</li>
								<li>
									Input the passphrase (remote RMI service name), which will then be encrypted by the 
									server key.
								</li>
								<li>
									When ready, click "OK" to proceed, or click "Cancel" to abort.
								</li>
								<li>
									You must then use other transfer mechanism to upload this file to remote server, then 
									activate the encrypted RMI serivce name by restarting the RMI Server with the -k option.
									<br>
