							RMIAdmin is a powerful software developed based on the Java<sup>TM</sup> RMI technology.
							
							<br><br><br>
							
							RMIAdmin allows System Administrators / Developers / Users to manage remote 
							computers over the network regardless of the target computer platform. 
							With the use of RMIAdmin, we could easily perform routine administrative 
							tasks in just one single interface. As a result easing the management of 
							multiple machine in a complex environment with mixed computer platform.
							
							<br><br><br>
							
							Here are the list of features provided:<br>
							
							<u>Core Utility</u>
							<ul color="#666666">
								<li>Invoke Operating System's command of remote computers locally.</li>
								<li>Perform file operation of remote computers locally</li>
								<li>Transfer of files between remote and local computers</li>
								<li>Monitoring the connection status of managed computers</li>
								<li>Graphical Remote Control (Beta) for accessing the remote desktop screen</li>
							</ul>
							
							<u>Extended Feature of the Core Utility</u>
							<ul color="#666666">
								<li>Command mode for customized shell scripting (Batch automation)</li>
								<li>API for programming plugin, integration with external system (<i>not yet available</i>)</li>
								<li>Server-side & Client-side logging feature</li>
								<li>Managed Server List export & import</li>
								<li>Encrypted Key Authentication</li>
								<li>Managing the memory performance of the JAVA VM of remote computers</li>
								<li>Auto-Upgrade to help you easily obtain latest enhancements as well as bug fix</li>

							<u>What is RMI Technology?</u>
							<br>
							Distributed systems require that computations running in 
							different address spaces, potentially on different hosts, 
							be able to communicate. For a basic communication mechanism, 
							the Java<sup>TM</sup> programming language supports sockets, 
							which are flexible and sufficient for general communication. 
							However, sockets require the client and server to engage in 
							applications-level protocols to encode and decode messages for 
							exchange, and the design of such protocols is cumbersome and 
							can be error-prone.
							<br><br>
							An alternative to sockets is Remote Procedure Call (RPC), which 
							abstracts the communication interface to the level of a procedure call. 
							Instead of working directly with sockets, the programmer has the 
							illusion of calling a local procedure, when in fact the arguments 
							of the call are packaged up and shipped off to the remote target 
							of the call. RPC systems encode arguments and return values using an 
							external data representation, such as XDR.
							<br><br>
							RPC, however, does not translate well into distributed object 
							systems, where communication between program-level objects residing 
							in different address spaces is needed. In order to match the semantics 
							of object invocation, distributed object systems require Remote Method 
							Invocation (RMI). In such systems, a local surrogate (stub) object 
							manages the invocation on a remote object.
							<br><br>
							The Java platform's remote method invocation system described 
							in this specification has been specifically designed to operate 
							in the Java application environment. The Java programming language's 
							RMI system assumes the homogeneous environment of the Java virtual 
							machine (JVM), and the system can therefore take advantage of the Java 
							platform's object model whenever possible.
							<br><br>
							RMI applications are often comprised of 
                        	two separate programs: a server and a client. A typical 
                        	server application creates some remote objects, makes 
                        	references to them accessible, and waits for clients to 
                        	invoke methods on these remote objects. A typical client 
                        	application gets a remote reference to one or more 
                        	remote objects in the server and then invokes methods on 
                        	them. RMI provides the mechanism by which the server and 
                        	the client communicate and pass information back and 
                        	forth. Such an application is sometimes referred to as a 
                        	distributed object application.
