# RMIAdmin

RMIAdmin is a cross platform remote administration software developed based on the Java RMI technology. RMIAdmin allows System Administrators/Developers/Users to manage remote computers over the network regardless of the target computer platform. With the use of RMIAdmin, you could easily perform routine administrative tasks in just one single interface. As a result easing the management of multiple machines in a complex environment with mixed computer platform.  

Unlike traditional remote control software, RMIAdmin does not capture the screen display of managed computers at remote network. It was originally created for the purpose of automating server administration tasks, as a result to increase efficiency and effectiveness. Rather than simply managing remote servers via local client, we also provide customization and extensibility, such as "Command Line Option", which allows administrator/developer to further automate tasks via scripting or batch job.
